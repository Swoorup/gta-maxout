# About #

gta-maxout is dynamic link library originally written for game modification: Grand Theft Auto: State Of Liberty. At the current moment I am transitioning the sources to work with all kinds of Total Conversion modifications for Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and also as an API for C++ developers to work internally with the game engine.

# History #

I had always been fascinated by computer games and wanted to know how they work internally. So I took the liberty to tweaking them a bit and was excited with what I would discover. Some few weeks later, with great inspiration and works of fellow modding community, I was able to release a map modification called [GTA:East Coast Stories](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=485587) for Grand Theft Auto: Vice City collaborating with 3 other members of the modding community.

At around 2010, I teamed with Keith Mckay, well known as [X-Seti](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showuser=91758) to help him with the exe [patching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)) that was required for [Grand Theft Auto: State Of Liberty](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=501707) in order to run the game's critical features that in normal condition would only be suited to the original game without any modification.
